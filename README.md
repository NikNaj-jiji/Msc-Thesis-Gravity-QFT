This repository hosts my Master's thesis, *"Gravity from a Quantum Field Theory viewpoint"*, submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at Imperial College London.

The thesis reviews several frameworks that describe gravity using tools and ideas from quantum field theory. Topics covered include:

- The necessity of gauge invariance for truly Lorentz-invariant theories of massless particles (photons and gravitons).
- Derivation of charge conservation and the equivalence principle using soft photon and soft graviton limits.
- Recovering the non-linear structure of General Relativity by coupling gravitons to matter fields and comparing with the Einstein-Hilbert action.
- Infrared modifications of gravity, including massive graviton theories and associated challenges.
- Application of Effective Field Theory (EFT) methods to gravitational waves, with a focus on binary black hole systems.
